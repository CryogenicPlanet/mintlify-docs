<Note>
 going to be using `openai` instead of `voice ai provider`, if yo have some other provider it should work the same more or less
</Note>

proxy modes are how you relay your `wss` (or `webrtc` in the future) connection between your `client` and your `voice ai provider`.


by your client, i generally mean your `browser` or `mobile` app.

<Info>
 if you are using a server to make calls, directly then you can skip this section.

## default proxy mode (in-secure)

here your `client` -> `volt relay` -> `openai`, where `volt` directly forwards all your authentication headers to `openai`.

this means your `openai-api-key` is exposed to both your `client` and to `volt`.

this is super straight forward and easy to setup, but it is not recommended for production use.

here is an example of what this looks like:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
participant Client
participant Volt Relay Server
participant OpenAI
participant Volt Auth Server
Client->>Volt Relay Server: Connect with VOLT API key and OPENAI API key
Volt Relay Server->>Volt Auth Server: Validate API key
Volt Auth Server-->>Volt Relay Server: API key valid
Volt Relay Server->>OpenAI: Connect with OPENAI API key
Client->>Volt Relay Server: Send message
Volt Relay Server->>OpenAI: Relay message
OpenAI-->>Volt Relay Server: Response
Volt Relay Server-->>Client: Relay response
```

## secure session proxy (draft)

<Note>this is not available yet, will be coming soon</Note>

explaing on that, i wouldn't use the word RFC cause not that big a company but you can think of this as a draft of what this might look like

here you would imagine something like the following:

- you store your `openai-api-key` in the `volt` dashboard, and get a secret key for this. the api key can only be decrypted with said `secret-key`
- your `server` creates a session with `volt auth server` with said `secret-key`, returns a `session-id` and a short lived token
- your `client` uses the `session-id` and `short-lived-token` to connect to `volt relay server`
- `volt relay server` connects to `openai` using the `openai-api-key`


```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Your Server
    participant Volt Auth Server
    participant Volt Relay Server
    participant OpenAI

    Your Server->>Volt Auth Server: Create session with secret key
    Volt Auth Server-->>Your Server: Return session-id and short-lived token
    Your Server->>Client: Provide session-id and short-lived token
    Client->>Volt Relay Server: Connect with session-id and short-lived token
    Volt Relay Server->>Volt Auth Server: Validate session and token
    Volt Auth Server-->>Volt Relay Server: Session valid, provide decrypted OpenAI API key
    Volt Relay Server->>OpenAI: Connect with OpenAI API key
    Client->>Volt Relay Server: Send message
    Volt Relay Server->>OpenAI: Relay message
    OpenAI-->>Volt Relay Server: Response
    Volt Relay Server-->>Client: Relay response
```
