you can clone and follow the readme, to get it working!

cloneable example here: https://github.com/CryogenicPlanet/volt-openai-realtime-console-example




## changes to make

1. update where the api key is gotten from `localStorage`
   
   ```ts
   const apiKey =
		localStorage.getItem("tmp::voice_api_key") ||
		prompt("OpenAI API Key") ||
		"";
	if (apiKey !== "") {
		localStorage.setItem("tmp::voice_api_key", apiKey);
	}```

2. update where the `RealtimeClient` is initialized

   ```ts
   const clientRef = useRef<RealtimeClient>(
		new RealtimeClient(
			USE_LOCAL_RELAY_SERVER_URL
				? {
						url: USE_LOCAL_RELAY_SERVER_URL,
						apiKey: apiKey,
						dangerouslyAllowAPIKeyInBrowser: true,
					}
				: {
						apiKey: apiKey,
						dangerouslyAllowAPIKeyInBrowser: true,
					},
		),
	);
	```

<Note>
the offical `@openai/realtime-api-beta` does not allow for custom query params in the url, this is blocking us from using it with `volt_token=`.


you could use `X-VOLT-TOKEN` in the headers instead but you would still need to patch the `@openai/realtime-api-beta` lib to allow for custom headers.

the before PR is the fix that for custom query params, you can follow along there:
https://github.com/openai/openai-realtime-api-beta/pull/11

for now, you can use an older version of `openai-realtime-console` with the sdk is inlined and can be fixed.
